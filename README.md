# :soccer: TezBet :soccer:

TezBet is a proposal for the Gitcoin's GameOn! hackathon. This project is the result of a four-people teamwork, comprised of two smart contract devs and two frontend devs. We are very grateful to our two advisors for their suggestions and support all along the project.

## A decentralized approach to soccer betting 

:soccer: TezBet is a decentralized application built on the Tezos blockchain. Its philosophy is to be fully self-sufficient, resulting in a both decentralized and automated alternative to the common centralized soccer betting applications. 

:moneybag: TezBet's principle relies on the zero-sum game theory, which means that the bet winners share the total bet amount. Using this mechanism, TezBet does not need to store any backing liquidity to pay the winners.

:heavy_division_sign: Potential gains are thus calculated upon the total bet amount on each possible outcome. We do not rely on any odds calculated by a third party entity.
